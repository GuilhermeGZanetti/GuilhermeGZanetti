### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Guilherme Goes Zanetti, currently studiyng computer engineering at UFES (Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo).

I've been from 2019 to 2021 a member of Projeto Solares Ufes, an extension project with a goal to spread and explore solar energy. There, I've worked on an android app - Solares On https://github.com/SolaresUfes/Solares-On - and on a telemetry software that exhibits data real time from a competiotion solar boat https://github.com/orgs/Collab-Barco-Solar/teams/projeto-solares/repositories, besides being in a leadership position on 2020.
