### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Guilherme Goes Zanetti, currently studiyng computer engineering at UFES (Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo).

I'm currently a member of Projeto Solares Ufes, an extension project with a goal to spread and explore solar energy. There, I've worked on an android app - Solares On https://github.com/SolaresUfes/Solares-On - and on a telemetry software that exhibits data real time from a competiotion solar boat.
